# MNIST Digit Recognizing 
Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks and OpenCV

We encorporate CNN along with standard Artificial Learning Networks for the classification of a set of Hand Written images to their corresponding digits.

Using the MNIST Dataset which contains 60K+ images as our training and validation dataset, we train our model.
